    "This project demonstrates how SQL and Python can be integrated to extract and analyze customer purchase data from a relational database. By joining five tables in the Chinook schema—Customer, Invoice, InvoiceLine, Track, and Album, I was able to trace each customer's purchases down to individual tracks and their corresponding albums. I used SQLite as my RDBMS for its simplicity and compatibility with Jupyter Notebook, and used SQLAlchemy as the middleware to manage the database connection. The SQL query was designed to ensure relational integrity and produce a clean, sorted output by customer last and first name. Using pandas to load the query results into a DataFrame allowed for easy inspection, and formatting. This approach shows the power of combining SQL for structured data extraction with Python for flexible analysis and presentation. This project visually shows the importance of clean schema design and efficient querying when working with real-world datasets."
