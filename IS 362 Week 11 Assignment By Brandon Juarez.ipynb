    "I selected the New York Times Top Stories API and registered for an API key through their developer portal. Using Python, I constructed a script that sends a request to the API for the \"technology\" section and retrieves the resulting JSON data. I then parsed the JSON response to extract key article attributes such as title, abstract, URL, publication date, and byline. These were organized into a structured pandas DataFrame, allowing for easy inspection and further analysis. The output successfully displayed a clean table of current top technology stories from the New York Times, demonstrating my ability to interface with a real-world API and transform its data into a usable format."
